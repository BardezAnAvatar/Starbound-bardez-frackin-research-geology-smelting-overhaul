# Starbound-bardez-frackin-research-geology-smelting-overhaul

This repo is a mod for [Starbound](https://playstarbound.com/), based on top of the following mods:
- [Frackin' Universe](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149)

This mod does the following:
- [ ] Overhauls the geology blacksmithing branch to furnaces, then tiers, group items according to tier
- [ ] Adds recipes for ore -> molten liquid for ores introduced in various liquid mods
- [ ] Puts molten liquids as a requirement before the bar form of an ore
- [ ] Organizes the alloys to have multiple parents
- [ ] Removes Protocite and irradium liquid states from chemistry research (leaves the recipes alone) and moves them to geology for smelting
